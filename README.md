# ClaimChunk
Simple chunk claiming system for Fabric.

## Basic commands:
/claim - claims current chunk
/unclaim - unclaims chunk
/info - displays info about current chunk's claim
/member [add/remove] [player] - adds player to your claim
/unclaimall - unclaims all your claims


If there's any problem with a mod, you can find me on Fabric's Discord server (nick: jestem_maciek)
